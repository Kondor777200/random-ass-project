## Why? tl;dr because colors are great, color models, not so much
- There are loads of color models, such as rgb, hex, rgba, hsl, hsv

after some timee, you'll convert the same color dozens of times, using different software,
which is a waste of time, and it makes your color theme to change w/o you wanting it or not.
